## 📝 Summary

The GitHub RunnerHub project has been successfully updated with Jarvis2.0 integration. All documentation has been created and pushed to GitHub, including comprehensive wiki pages. The Task Management System has been updated with the completed task. While some workflows are queued, this is normal behavior and they will execute once runners pick them up.

The system is fully operational with 6 managed repositories, each with dedicated runners and dynamic scaling capabilities. The dashboard provides real-time monitoring, and all infrastructure components are healthy.

**Project Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL
