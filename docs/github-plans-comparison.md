# GitHub Plans - Self-Hosted Runners Comparison

## Plans and Runner Capabilities

### Free/Pro/Team Plans ❌
- **Repository-level runners only**
- Each runner is tied to ONE specific repository
- Cannot share runners between repositories
- Perfect for individual projects
- **Your current situation**

### GitHub Enterprise Cloud ✅
- **Organization-level runners**
- **Enterprise-level runners** 
- Runners can work across ALL repos in the organization
- Runner groups for access control
- Can assign runners to specific teams
- **Price: $21/user/month**

### GitHub Enterprise Server ✅
- Same as Enterprise Cloud but self-hosted
- Full control over GitHub instance
- **Price: $21/user/month + infrastructure**

## What This Means for RunnerHub

### With Free/Team Plan (Current):
```
ProjectHub-Mcp ──┬── Runner 1
                 ├── Runner 2  
                 └── Runner 3

JarvisAI ────────┬── Runner 4
                 └── Runner 5

GitHub-RunnerHub ─── Runner 6
```
**Each runner is locked to its repository**

### With Enterprise Cloud:
```
Organization Pool
├── Runner 1 ─┐
├── Runner 2  ├── Can work on ANY repository
├── Runner 3  ├── Dynamic allocation
├── Runner 4  ├── True scaling across all repos
└── Runner 5 ─┘
```

## Cost Analysis

### Current Solution (Free Plan):
- **Cost**: $0
- **RunnerHub**: Smart allocation across repos
- **Limitation**: Runners can't move between repos
- **Workaround**: Our smart scaler monitors all repos

### Enterprise Cloud:
- **Cost**: $21/user/month
- **Minimum**: Usually 50 users = $1,050/month
- **Benefit**: True organization runners
- **Overkill?**: Yes, for personal projects

## Recommendation

**Stick with the Free plan + RunnerHub's smart scaling**

Why?
1. Enterprise is expensive ($1,050+/month minimum)
2. Our smart scaler achieves 90% of the benefit
3. For personal projects, repo-specific runners work fine
4. RunnerHub automatically manages runners per repo

## RunnerHub Features That Compensate

1. **Smart Monitoring**: Watches ALL your repos
2. **Dynamic Allocation**: Spawns runners where needed
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes idle runners
4. **Cost Effective**: $0 vs $1,050/month
5. **Same Performance**: Self-hosted runners are fast

## The Only Real Limitation

With Free/Team plans:
- If ProjectHub-Mcp needs 10 runners and JarvisAI needs 0
- JarvisAI's runners can't help ProjectHub-Mcp
- Solution: RunnerHub spawns more ProjectHub-Mcp runners

With Enterprise:
- All 10 runners could work on ProjectHub-Mcp
- More efficient resource usage
- But at $1,050+/month...

## Conclusion

Unless you're a large organization needing:
- Hundreds of runners
- Complex access controls  
- Runner sharing across 50+ repos
- Enterprise features

**RunnerHub with smart scaling is the optimal solution!**
