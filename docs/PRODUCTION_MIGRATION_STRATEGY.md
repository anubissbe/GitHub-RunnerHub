- Gradual migration with validation at each step

#### 2. Container Resource Exhaustion
**Risk**: Containers consuming more resources than expected  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive load testing before migration
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Auto-scaling policies configured

#### 3. Network Connectivity Issues
**Risk**: Container networking causing job failures  
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive network testing in staging
- Network monitoring and alerting
- Fallback to host networking if needed

#### 4. Performance Degradation
**Risk**: New system slower than legacy system  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Performance benchmarking in staging
- Performance SLA monitoring
- Instant rollback capability

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. **Traffic Routing**
   - Revert load balancer configuration
   - Route 100% traffic back to legacy system
   - Notify operations team

2. **Data Sync**
   - Stop new system job processing
   - Sync any pending jobs back to legacy system
   - Validate queue consistency

#### Extended Rollback (< 30 minutes)
1. **System State**
   - Capture new system state for analysis
   - Export any new configuration changes
   - Document rollback reason

2. **Recovery**
   - Restart legacy system services if needed
   - Validate full functionality
   - Resume normal operations
