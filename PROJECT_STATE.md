## Key Decisions Made
1. **Architecture Pattern**: Proxy Runner with ephemeral containers
2. **Technology Stack**: 
   - Node.js/TypeScript for orchestration service
   - BullMQ for job queue
   - PostgreSQL for state management
   - Docker for container orchestration
3. **Security Approach**: Full isolation with Vault integration
4. **Scaling Strategy**: Dynamic container provisioning

## Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Create runner pool management system~~ COMPLETED
2. ✅ ~~Implement monitoring dashboard~~ COMPLETED
3. ✅ ~~Add WebSocket real-time updates~~ COMPLETED
4. ✅ ~~Implement container lifecycle management~~ COMPLETED
5. ✅ ~~Add auto-scaling logic (80-90% trigger)~~ COMPLETED
6. ✅ ~~Create job routing based on labels~~ COMPLETED
7. ✅ ~~Implement automated cleanup for idle containers~~ COMPLETED
8. ✅ ~~Add GitHub webhook integration~~ COMPLETED  
9. Create integration tests
10. Test with actual GitHub Actions
11. Add authentication middleware
12. Create deployment scripts

## Important Context
- This is a complete restart of the GitHub-RunnerHub project
- Previous implementation was a simpler auto-scaling solution
- New approach provides enterprise-grade isolation and security
- Targets organizations with strict compliance requirements

## Technical Considerations
- All services run on Synology NAS (192.168.1.24)
- Vault already available at 192.168.1.24:8200
- PostgreSQL available at 192.168.1.24:5433
- Must integrate with existing infrastructure

## Risk Assessment
- **Complexity**: High - requires significant engineering effort
- **Security**: Critical - must implement all security controls
- **Performance**: Must handle <2s job assignment latency
- **Maintenance**: Requires dedicated ops resources

## Architecture Highlights
```
GitHub Actions → Proxy Runners → Orchestration Service → Docker Containers
```

- Proxy runners are persistent and lightweight
- Jobs execute in ephemeral, single-use containers
- Complete isolation between job executions
- Centralized monitoring and control plane
